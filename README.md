Note: 
1. I have not written any REST end point to invoke the method.
2. I have not taken "devDependencies" into account.



Information: there is one exception while invoking ur - unauthorized 401 exception. 

1. To run the application, follow below steps

2. Download the zip file and unzip.

3. In terminal, go to the unzipped location and type "mvn clea install"

4. This will run the junit for "forever" package name.

thanks
